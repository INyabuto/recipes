__As we celebrate this Madaraka day, I thought to try out something new with my family. This is not so new as such, it is something that I have ever tried but after a very long time, and with very little hopes of getting back to it again, baking!__

I wanted to learn how to bake scones, not just any other scones but soft, spongy, and testier scones to serve for breakfast.

Here is what I did differently, and surprisingly, it turned out to be the softer, spongier, and testier scones ever made at our house!

- I used the right amounts of yeast. Yeast is what causes the dough to rise. Too much of it will not make the dough to rise higher. A good amount is 10g of instant yeast per 1 kg of flour, one of the chefs told me at the supermarket. 
- I also used the right amount of oil and sugar. A good mixture of oil and sugar can improve the rising of the dough and the general texture of the scones. Too much of it isn’t good either. It can stop the dough from getting to its optimum size, resulting in dense or heavy scones.
- I added some tablespoons of dried milk. I learned this from a friend, Dried milk enhances the rising of the dough. There are other many ingredients you could use, but this one just worked out perfectly.
- Allow the dough to rise for a second time. Important! Once you’ve shaped the dough, it’s good to allow that dough to rise again for about 30 mins or until it has increased by 1 inch its size before baking.
